# PERFORMANCE  AND ACCURACY ANALYSIS OF SVM AND KNN

The classifiers SVM and KNN were both implmented using Flask for web and in linux platforms to measure the below parameters.

1. Cross-validation score
2. Estimation Time (secs)
3. Prediction Accuracy
4. Prediction Time (secs)
5. Memory Utilization (MB)

The system performenace analysis was performed on the standard iris dataset. However, the results will vary depending on the size of dataset, system configuration and code optimization.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Platform : Web
1. Install the required dependencies for Flask app such as Flask, numpy, sklearn.
2. Run the python program, using below command.
    'FLASK_APP=classifier_web.py flask run'

### Platform : Linux    
1. For running the python program install the required dependencies such as pandas, numpy, sklearn as required. (all libraries that are imported should be installed using pip install)
2. Run the python program, using below command.
'python filename.py'
